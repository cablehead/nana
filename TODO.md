# TODO

- [ ] Up / Down for history - perhaps using the in-memory `cards` that already exist
- [ ] Sidebar navigation
- [ ] In-app documentation (maybe via sidebar?)
- [ ] Non-interactive externals should require a keypress before the window closes
- [ ] Save/restore session
- [ ] configuration so we can change the table like `border: 2px solid green` and change alignment like `center` or `left`, and please give me `dark` mode
- [ ] would love to have some drag-n-drop gui widgets, maybe from the sidebar navigation
- [ ] hook up more ansi colors - may have to look into nushell's `is_tty` function that strips ansi and make it work for nana
- [ ] yes, i want an easter egg - i have one in mind :) it's a secret but it goes with the theme
